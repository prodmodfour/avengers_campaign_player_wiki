| Level | Spell Name               | BP Cost | Flavor                                                                                           |
|-------|---------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Catapult                 | 1       | You condense a pocket of high-pressure air behind an object and release it, launching it like a bullet. |
| 1     | Feather Fall             | 1       | You create a sudden updraft to slow the descent of yourself or falling allies.                   |
| 1     | Fog Cloud                | 1       | You churn the air violently against the ground, kicking up a thick sphere of dust and debris (rather than water vapor). |
| 1     | Jump                     | 1       | You create a burst of compressed air under your feet to propel you upward.                       |
| 1     | Longstrider              | 1       | You manipulate currents to reduce wind resistance, allowing a target to move faster.             |
| 1     | Shield                   | 1       | You reflexively compress the air around you into a solid, glass-like barrier to deflect an attack. |
| 1     | Thunderwave              | 1       | You create a wave of concussive air pressure that knocks enemies back and deals damage.          |
| 1     | Zephyr Strike            | 1       | You wrap yourself in swirling winds, increasing your speed and preventing enemies from hitting you. |
| 2     | Blur                     | 2       | You vibrate the air around you, creating heat shimmers and density changes that make you hard to hit. |
| 2     | Dust Devil               | 2       | You create a localized whirlwind that batters enemies and kicks up blinding debris.              |
| 2     | Gust of Wind             | 2       | A classic technique; you create a sustained, powerful blast of wind in a line.                   |
| 2     | Hold Person              | 2       | You increase the atmospheric pressure immensely around a target, pinning them to the ground.     |
| 2     | Knock                    | 2       | You create a sharp, focused point of high pressure inside a lock to force the mechanism open.    |
| 2     | Levitate                 | 2       | You manipulate the air pressure under a creature or object to hold it aloft.                     |
| 2     | Skywrite                 | 2       | You shape existing clouds or manipulate smoke with precise currents to form words in the sky.    |
| 2     | Warding Wind             | 2       | Strong wind swirls around you, deflecting projectiles (arrows) and making movement difficult for enemies. |
| 3     | Fly                      | 3       | You command the air to physically carry you, allowing for true, sustained flight.                |
| 3     | Haste                    | 3       | You create a perfect aerodynamic tunnel around a target and use tailwinds to double their speed. |
| 3     | Protection from Energy   | 3       | You create a cycling shield of air that disperses heat (Fire) or insulates against temperature (Cold). |
| 3     | Wind Wall                | 3       | You create a vertical wall of screaming, high-velocity wind that deflects arrows and blocks passage. |
| 4     | Freedom of Movement      | 4       | You create a layer of pressurized, slick air over your skin, making it impossible to be grappled. |
| 4     | Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere | 4     | You create a sphere of air compressed so tightly it becomes as hard as diamond, trapping a creature. |
