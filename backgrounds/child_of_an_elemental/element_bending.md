# How does bending work?

You get a number of "bending" points based on your character level. These points can be used to cast spells from the Wizard, Sorcerer and Ranger spell lists.

Each spell costs bending points equal to the level of the spell you cast. The max level of spell that you can cast is determined by your character level. 

You can cast spells that would be possible to achieve by bending the element that you chose. For example, a child of a fire elemental could use 3 bending points to cast Fireball.

## Creative Bending
You can be creative when considering "What is possible by bending your chosen element". At the DM's discretion, you can even modify the spell to make it fit better. 

For example, a water bender could cast Hold Person by bending the water within the targets blood. In this case, we'd modify the spell to use a CON Save instead of a WIS Save.
