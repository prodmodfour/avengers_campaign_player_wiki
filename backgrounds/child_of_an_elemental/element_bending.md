# Elemental Bending

## How Bending Works

As a Child of an Elemental, you gain a number of **Bending Points** determined by your character level. These points allow you to shape and manipulate your chosen element to perform extraordinary feats — represented mechanically as spells.

You may spend Bending Points to cast spells from the **Wizard**, **Sorcerer**, or **Ranger** spell lists.  
Each spell costs a number of Bending Points equal to the spell’s level.

The **maximum spell level** you can cast also depends on your character level (see the table below).

You can only cast spells that could reasonably be accomplished through control of your chosen element. For example, a **Child of a Fire Elemental** could spend 3 Bending Points to cast *Fireball*.

Cantrips cost 0 points.

## Creative Bending

You are encouraged to think creatively about how your elemental powers manifest. At your DM’s discretion, you may modify existing spells to better suit your element.

For instance, a **Water Bender** might emulate *Hold Person* by manipulating the water within a target’s body — in which case, the DM might change the saving throw from **Wisdom** to **Constitution**.
