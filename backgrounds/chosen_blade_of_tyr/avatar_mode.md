# Avatar Mode

Once per day, as an action, you may surrender your body to Tyr, becoming the Avatar of Tyr for one round. During this time, you lose control of your character, and the Avatar of Tyr acts on your initiative.

At the end of the Avatarâ€™s turn, you can attempt a DC 20 Concentration check. On a success, you remain in Avatar form for an additional round.

When you revert to your original form, you do not retain any damage or conditions suffered by the Avatar of Tyr. If the Avatar of Tyr is reduced to 0 hit points, you immediately return to your normal form.

Only one player can embody the Avatar of Tyr at any given time.  
This ability recharges after a long rest.
