# Avatar Mode

Once per day, as an action, you can give your body to Tyr. You become the Avatar of Tyr for one round. You lose control of your character. The Avatar of Tyr takes a full turn on your initiative.

At the end of your turn, if you make a DC 20 concentration check, you may remain as the Avatar of Tyr for another round. 

Once you revert back to your original form, you do not retain any damage of conditions suffered by the Avatar of Tyr. If the Avatar of Tyr dies, you revert back to your original form. 

Two players cannot be the Avatar of Tyr at the same time. 
This ability is restored during a long rest.
