# Basic Info

A few years ago, you heard the sound of the ocean call to you. You followed it and found yourself wandering an endless stretch of grey sand. After what felt like centuries to you, you arrived at an ocean of darkness. You found a worm, a wriggling mass of black tendrils. You ate it without thinking. 

After eating it, you returned to the mortal plane. Time had not passed in this world, even though you experienced centuries in the realm of the dark ocean. 

Over the course of the next few days, your body morphed slowly and painfully into its new, crablike form. Your mind changed and gained knowledge that you had no way of knowing.

You learn that there are other similar to you. Other crab people. But they are lesser spawn. You are the Grand Spawn of the Dark Ocean. The prophet sent to free the universe from the cosmic forces that seek to enslave it. 

With your psychic powers, you learn that there is one other like you. Another Grand Spawn, Melorias. Your new crab instincts tell you to destroy him, to eat him and take his place as the leader of the Dark Oceanspawn. He is weak, and only you can save the universe. 

# You get:
* Crab Mutations
