# Basic Info

Years ago, you heard the ocean calling your name — a voice deep and patient, older than the tides themselves. You followed it across an endless shore of gray sand, walking for what felt like centuries. At last, you reached the Dark Ocean — a vast sea of shadow that swallowed all light.

There, you found a creature: a worm made of writhing black tendrils. Without hesitation, you devoured it.

When you awoke, you were back in the mortal realm. No time had passed, though your mind is now that of an ancient.

Over the next few days, your body began to twist and harden, reshaping itself into a crablike form. Your mind expanded, flooded with knowledge you could not have learned by mortal means.

You soon discovered that others like you exist — lesser spawn, fragments of the same deep power. But you are not like them. You are the **Grand Spawn of the Dark Ocean**, the chosen prophet destined to liberate the cosmos from the unseen forces that bind it.

Through your newly awakened psychic senses, you perceive another Grand Spawn — **Melorias**. Your instincts whisper that only one can rule the Dark Ocean’s children. To save the universe, you must find him, devour him, and claim his power.

# You Gain:

* **Crab Mutations**
* **Psychic Powers**
* **A Lesser Spawn** (your loyal crab companion)
