# Lesser Spawn of the Dark Ocean

A **Lesser Spawn** is a person who has consumed a worm from the Dark Ocean, transforming into the weakest form of spawn — a hulking, crab-like creature. This Lesser Spawn serves as your **Retainer**.

---

## Retainer Rules
* Retainers act on your initiative.
* They do not attack independently. However, if you deal damage to a creature on your turn and that creature is within the Lesser Spawn’s range, the Retainer can choose to deal its set damage to that creature during your turn.
* Damage dealt is a fixed amount.
