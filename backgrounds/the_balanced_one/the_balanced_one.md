# Basic Info

## What is "The Balanced One"?
You are a werewolf. But you're not like other werewolves. You're The Balanced One.

Most werewolves fall into two categories:
* Beings of Chaos
* Beings of Order

When a person is turned into a werewolf, they become either one of the two based on whether their soul is more chaotic or ordered.

Both types are incompatible with civil society. They are incapable of thought that is outside of their nature. 

You contain within you both natures. Your mind has the capacity for chaos and order. Most beings have one thought at a time. You have two parallel thoughts at any given moment. The Chaotic Thought and the Ordered Thought. You can choose to act on either.

You are the only one of your kind that you know. Other werewolves view you with reverence and fear. 

## Order vs Chaos
When in either hybrid or wolf form, chaos wolves are black whereas order wolves are white.

Your fur is black in some parts and white in others. The percentage of white vs black fur is determined by how chaotic or ordered your soul is. 

You have a number of Chaos Points.
You have a number of Order Points.
They both add up to 5. 

Whenever you make a decision that is strongly in line with your chaotic self, you gain a Chaos point and lose an Order point. 

Whenever you make a decision that is strongly in line with your ordered self, you gain an Order point and lose a Chaos point. 

Whenever you make a choice that is in between the two, your balance remains the same. 

## Loss of Control
If you lose control of your character due to a mental effect, or experience a mental condition such as frightened or charmed, you must make a DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw.

If you fail, you partially lose control of your character and your most dominant side (order or chaos) takes over. Every minute, you may make another saving throw. You may still make decisions, but they must strongly be in line with your most dominant side.

If you lose control and you have not shifted, you immediately shift into hybrid form.


## How does one become a werewolf?
If a creature is dealt damage by either a werewolf's claw or bite attacks, they contract the lycanthropy disease. 

After 4d8 days, the creature makes a DC 12 Con saving throw. If they fail, they become a werewolf.
