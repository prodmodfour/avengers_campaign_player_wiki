# Basic Info

## What is *The Balanced One*?

You are a werewolf — but unlike any other. You are *The Balanced One*.

Most werewolves fall into one of two categories:
- **Beings of Chaos**
- **Beings of Order**

When a person is transformed into a werewolf, the curse molds itself to the nature of their soul. Those with a disciplined mind become creatures of Order. Those with a wild heart become creatures of Chaos.

Both are powerful, yet both are flawed. Their thoughts are bound to their nature — incapable of balance or moderation.

You are different. You embody both natures in harmony. Within you reside two minds: one ordered, one chaotic. They exist in constant dialogue, sometimes in conflict, yet always together.  
At any given moment, you can choose which voice to follow — the Chaotic Thought or the Ordered Thought.

You have never met another like yourself. Among werewolves, you are an anomaly — revered by some, feared by most.

## Order vs. Chaos

When in hybrid or wolf form:
- **Chaos-aligned werewolves** have black fur.
- **Order-aligned werewolves** have white fur.

Your fur bears both colors — a living reflection of your inner balance. The ratio of black to white changes as your soul shifts between order and chaos.

You track this with **Chaos Points** and **Order Points**, which always total **5**.

- When you act according to your chaotic nature, **gain 1 Chaos Point** and **lose 1 Order Point**.  
- When you act according to your ordered nature, **gain 1 Order Point** and **lose 1 Chaos Point**.  
- When you make a neutral choice, your balance remains unchanged.

## Loss of Control

When your mind is compromised — whether by fear, charm, madness, or other mental effects — you risk losing balance.

You must succeed on a **DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw**.  
On a failure, your dominant nature (Order or Chaos) seizes control.

While under this influence:
- You may still act, but your choices must align with your dominant nature.  
- You can repeat the saving throw once per minute to regain control.  
- If you have not yet transformed, you immediately shift into **hybrid form** upon losing control.

## Becoming a Werewolf

A creature that takes damage from a werewolf’s **claw** or **bite** may contract the curse of lycanthropy.

After **4d8 days**, the creature makes a **DC 12 Constitution Saving Throw**.  
On a failure, they succumb to the transformation and become a werewolf.
