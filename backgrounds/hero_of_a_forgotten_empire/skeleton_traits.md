# Skeleton Traits

## Not So Squishy
Gain 2 HP per Hit Dice

## Brittle
Take +5 damage whenever you take bludgeoning damage

## Freedom of Bones
Gain +2 Dex Score (Not modifier)

## A Second Chance
You now have the Undead type in addition to your other types.

## Good Riddance to all the earthly remains
Condition immunities gained: Poisoned, Disease, Exhaustion

## DM Note
I'm ruling that no healing works on undead unless is explicitly states that it does. No healing word.
