# Basic Info

Six millennia ago, you were sealed away by the heroes of your age within the **Tomb of Heroes**. Once, you stood among the greatest champions of an empire whose name has long since been erased from history.

Now, the tomb has been opened once more. The world you awaken to faces ruin at the hands of the mad god **Loki**.

Haunted by the sins of your fallen empire, you vow to make amends. To atone, you will destroy Loki’s Avatar. It should be an easy task—for you were once the most powerful hero the world had ever known.  
At least, that’s what you remember.
