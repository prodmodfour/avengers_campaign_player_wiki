# The Kingdom of Galos

*A land ruled by serpents, served by humans.*

## Overview

Galos is unique among the kingdoms of the world: it is ruled not by humans, but by three ancient serpents who have lived since before recorded history. The humans of Galos are not subjects in the traditional sense—they are **trusted servants** who carry out the will of their serpent rulers.

For over three thousand years, this arrangement brought prosperity and peace to the fertile valleys of Galos. The serpents protected their human servants, and the humans devoted themselves to their serpent lords.

**Current Status:** Fallen. Conquered by Loki's forces three years ago.

## The Royal Serpents

The true rulers of Galos are three enormous serpents, each larger than a mammoth and utterly immune to magic:

| Serpent | Title | Domain |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Keragross the Emerald** | The Protector | Strength, defense, warfare |
| **Virelia the Sapphire** | The Wise | Counsel, diplomacy, foresight |
| **Zantheris the Ruby** | The Vigilant | Passion, celebration, watchfulness |

The serpents have lived for millennia. They remember the world before human civilization. They watched a hundred generations of humans serve them faithfully—from birth to death, their children after them, and their children's children.

## The High Steward

While the serpents ruled, humans managed the day-to-day affairs of the kingdom. The most trusted human servant held the title of **High Steward**—not a king, but a voice who spoke for the serpents and carried out their will.

The High Steward wore the **Covenant Crown**, a platinum diadem set with three gems freely given by the serpents. The Crown allowed telepathic communication with the serpent rulers across any distance.

## The Fall of Galos

When Loki's forces swept across the continent, Galos held longer than most. The serpents—immune to magic—could not be corrupted by the Chalice of Delusion or destroyed by divine power. For six months, Galos stood defiant.

Then Loki learned about the Covenant Crown.

Sark Gibb led a strike team into the Serpent Palace. They killed High Steward Aldric and his family, then stole the Crown. Using dark rituals, Loki corrupted the Crown into a tool of domination. The serpents—once wise rulers who loved their human servants—were reduced to mindless beasts forced to serve the very evil they would have died to stop.

## Notable Figures

### Figaros the Bold
A mighty human warrior who saved Galos from the Three-Eyed Cyclops. The serpents considered him a dear friend—one of the few humans they addressed as an equal rather than a servant. He has since been freed from Loki's control and now serves as an ally to the Avengers.

### Elara
Daughter of High Steward Aldric. Rumored to have been smuggled out of Galos during the fall. Her current whereabouts are unknown.
