# Minion Rules
## Interaction with minions
* Minions have no HP. They die when they take any damage. You don't roll damage against them.
* Minions have no AC. You don't roll to hit them. You declare an attack as normal, but you simply assume that you hit. 
* Whenever you kill a minion with an attack, you may make another attack on a minion as a free action on the same turn. 
* Unless states otherwise; All minions on the same side share a single initiative count, and they act after all non-minions.
* Minions automatically fail saving throws.

## Minion Attacks
* A minion rolls to attack as normal.
* A minion does set damage based on its stat block.

## Group Attacks
* A group of minions can attack as a single action.
* The group rolls a single attack roll.
* If the attack hits, each minion in the group deals its damage to the target.
